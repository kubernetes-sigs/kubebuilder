  This script runs goreleaser using the build/.goreleaser.yml config.
  While it can be run locally, it is intended to be run by cloudbuild
  in the goreleaser/goreleaser image.

  GORELEASER_FLAGS: contains flags to pass to the goreleaser binary (default: only --config is set).

  SNAPSHOT: if set to any value, runs goreleaser in snapshot mode with mock release notes (default: unset).

  NOTES_FLAGS: contains flags to pass to the notes binary (sigs.k8s.io/kubebuilder-release-tools/notes).
               Does nothing if SNAPSHOT is set. (default: unset).

  Examples:

  # Run in snapshot mode: fake release notes, nothing is published, binaries build in '$(pwd)/dist'
  \$ SNAPSHOT=1 $0

  # Add a release type to the release notes
  \$ NOTES_FLAGS=\"-r beta\" $0
"
}

# GORELEASER_FLAGS contains flags for goreleaser such that the binary can be run
# in local/snapshot/prod mode from the same script.
# NOTE: if --snapshot is in GORELEASER_FLAGS, the release is not published to GitHub
# and the build is available under $PWD/dist.
GORELEASER_FLAGS="${GORELEASER_FLAGS:-}"
# NOTES_FLAGS contains flags for the release notes generator (see install_notes for details).
NOTES_FLAGS="${NOTES_FLAGS:-}"
# SNAPSHOT is set by the CLI flag parser if --snapshot is a passed flag.
# If not set, release notes are not generated.
SNAPSHOT="${SNAPSHOT:-}"
