// NewUpdateCommand creates and returns a new Cobra command for updating Kubebuilder projects.
// This command helps users upgrade their projects to newer versions of Kubebuilder by performing
// a three-way merge between:
// - The original scaffolding (ancestor)
// - The user's current project state (current)
// - The new version's scaffolding (upgrade)
//
// The update process creates multiple Git branches to facilitate the merge and help users
// resolve any conflicts that may arise during the upgrade process.
func NewUpdateCommand() *cobra.Command {
	opts := update.Update{}
	updateCmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "update",
		Short: "Update a Kubebuilder project to a newer version",
		Long: `This command upgrades your Kubebuilder project to the latest scaffold layout using a 3-way merge strategy.

It performs the following steps:
  1. Creates an 'ancestor' branch from the version originally used to scaffold the project
  2. Creates a 'current' branch with your project's current state
  3. Creates an 'upgrade' branch using the new version's scaffolding
  4. Attempts a 3-way merge into a 'merge' branch

The process uses Git branches:
  - ancestor: clean scaffold from the original version
  - current: your existing project state
  - upgrade: scaffold from the target version
  - merge: result of the 3-way merge

If conflicts occur during the merge, the command will stop and leave the merge branch for manual resolution.
Use --force to commit conflicts with markers instead. 

Examples:
  # Update from the version specified in the PROJECT file to the latest release
  kubebuilder alpha update

  # Update from a specific version to the latest release
  kubebuilder alpha update --from-version v4.6.0

  # Update from a specific version to an specific release
  kubebuilder alpha update --from-version v4.5.0 --to-version v4.7.0	

  # Force update even with merge conflicts (commit conflict markers)
  kubebuilder alpha update --force
