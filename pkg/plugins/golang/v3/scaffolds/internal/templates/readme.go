## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster ` + "`kubectl cluster-info`" + ` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

%s

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by ` + "`IMG`" + `:

%s

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by ` + "`IMG`" + `:

%s

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

%s

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

%s

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

%s

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

%s

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: ` + "`make install run`" + `

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

%s

**NOTE:** Run ` + "`make --help`" + ` for more information on all potential ` + "`make`" + ` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)
