* If this is an issue with some sort of runtime mechanics, it probably belongs in https://sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime instead
* If this is an issue with CRD generation or webhook config generation, it probably belongs in sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools instead
* If this is an issue with scaffolding, or is definitely a cross repository effort, it probably belongs here.

Hiya!  Welcome to KubeBuilder!  For a smooth issue process, try to answer the following questions.
Don't worry if they're not all applicable; just try to include what you can :-)

If you need to include code snippets or logs, please put them in fenced code
blocks.  If they're super-long, please use the details tag like
<details><summary>super-long log</summary> lots of stuff </details>

<!-- What broke (please include exact error messages if you can) -->

<!-- What did you expect to happen?  What do you think went wrong? -->

<!-- If you don't know what broke, but have a minimal reproducer, that would be super-helpful helpful! -->

<!--

What versions of software are you using?  Specifically, the following are often useful:

* go version
* kubebuilder version (`kubebuilder version`) and scaffolding version (check your `PROJECT` file)
* controller-runtime version (check your `go.mod` file)
* controller-tools version
* Kubernetes & kubectl versions (just run `kubectl version` against your API server)
