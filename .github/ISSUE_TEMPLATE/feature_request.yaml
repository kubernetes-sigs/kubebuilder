      * If this is an issue with some sort of **runtime mechanics**,
        it probably belongs in [controller-runtime][cr-issue] instead

      * If this is an issue with **CRD generation**, webhook config generation,
        or deepcopy generation, it probably belongs in [controller-tools][ct-issue].

      * If this is an issue with **scaffolding**, or is definitely a
        cross-repository effort, it probably belongs here.  Feel free to continue :wink:

      # Hiya!  Welcome to Kubebuilder!
      
      For a smooth issue process, try to answer the following questions.
      Don't worry if they're not all applicable; just try to include what you can :smile:

      If you need to include code snippets or logs, please put them in fenced code
      blocks, and if they're really long, use the [`<details>` tag][mdn-details], like:

      <details>

      <summary>Code & details examples</summary>
      
      `````markdown
      Some code code written in Go:

      ```go
      type Manager struct {
        // FixTheBug removes all bugs from controller-runtime
        FixTheBug bool
      }
      ```

      <details>

      <summary>Some really long logs</summary>

      ```
      ok
      ok
      ok
      SHOOT A BUG HAPPENS HERE OH NO
      ok
      ok
      done
      ```

      </details>

      `````

      What are your use cases?  Why should we do this?

      Does it require a particular Kubernetes version?

      Is there currently another isssue associated with this (use github syntax
      like `#xyz` to link to it)?
