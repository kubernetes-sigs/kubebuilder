# Documentation for contributors

Contributions are welcome, but since development is so active, we request that you file an issue and claim it before starting to work on something. Otherwise, it is likely that we might already be working on a fix for your issue.

## Finding issues

All `gopls` issues are labeled as such (see the [`gopls` label][issue-gopls]). Issues that are suitable for contributors are additionally tagged with the [`help-wanted` label][issue-wanted].

Before you begin working on an issue, please leave a comment that you are claiming it.
