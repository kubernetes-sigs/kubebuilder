# Sublime Text

Use the [LSP] package. After installing it using Package Control, do the following:

* Open the **Command Palette**
* Find and run the command **LSP: Enable Language Server Globally**
* Select the **gopls** item. Be careful not to select the similarly named *golsp* by mistake.

Finally, you should familiarise yourself with the LSP package's *Settings* and *Key Bindings*. Find them under the menu item **Preferences > Package Settings > LSP**.
