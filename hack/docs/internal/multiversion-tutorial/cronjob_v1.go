const cronjobSpecComment = `/*
 First, let's take a look at our spec.  As we discussed before, spec holds
 *desired state*, so any "inputs" to our controller go here.

 Fundamentally a CronJob needs the following pieces:

 - A schedule (the *cron* in CronJob)
 - A template for the Job to run (the
 *job* in CronJob)

 We'll also want a few extras, which will make our users' lives easier:

 - A deadline for starting jobs (if we miss this deadline, we'll just wait till
   the next scheduled time)
 - What to do if multiple jobs would run at once (do we wait? stop the old one? run both?)
 - A way to pause the running of a CronJob, in case something's wrong with it
 - Limits on old job history

 Remember, since we never read our own status, we need to have some other way to
 keep track of whether a job has run.  We can use at least one old job to do
 this.

 We'll use several markers (` + "`// +comment`" + `) to specify additional metadata.  These
 will be used by [controller-tools](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools) when generating our CRD manifest.
 As we'll see in a bit, controller-tools will also use GoDoc to form descriptions for
 the fields.

const concurrencyPolicyComment = `/*
 We define a custom type to hold our concurrency policy.  It's actually
 just a string under the hood, but the type gives extra documentation,
 and allows us to attach validation on the type instead of the field,
 making the validation more easily reusable.
*/`

const statusDesignComment = `/*
 Next, let's design our status, which holds observed state.  It contains any information
 we want users or other controllers to be able to easily obtain.

 We'll keep a list of actively running jobs, as well as the last time that we successfully
 ran our job.  Notice that we use ` + "`metav1.Time`" + ` instead of ` + "`time.Time`" + ` to get the stable
 serialization, as mentioned above.

/*
 Since we'll have more than one version, we'll need to mark a storage version.
 This is the version that the Kubernetes API server uses to store our data.
 We'll chose the v1 version for our project.

 We'll use the [` + "`+kubebuilder:storageversion`" + `](/reference/markers/crd.md) to do this.

 Note that multiple versions may exist in storage if they were written before
 the storage version changes -- changing the storage version only affects how
 objects are created/updated after the change.
