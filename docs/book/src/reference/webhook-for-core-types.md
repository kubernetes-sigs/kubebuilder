# Admission Webhook for Core Types

It is very easy to build admission webhooks for CRDs, which has been covered in
the [CronJob tutorial][cronjob-tutorial]. Given that kubebuilder doesn't support webhook scaffolding
for core types, you have to use the library from controller-runtime to handle it.
There is an [example](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/tree/master/examples/builtins)
in controller-runtime.

It is suggested to use kubebuilder to initialize a project, and then you can
follow the steps below to add admission webhooks for core types.

## Implement Your Handler

You need to have your handler implements the
[admission.Handler](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/webhook/admission?tab=doc#Handler)
interface.

```go
type podAnnotator struct {
	Client  client.Client
	decoder *admission.Decoder
}

func (a *podAnnotator) Handle(ctx context.Context, req admission.Request) admission.Response {
	pod := &corev1.Pod{}
	err := a.decoder.Decode(req, pod)
	if err != nil {
		return admission.Errored(http.StatusBadRequest, err)
	}

	// mutate the fields in pod

	marshaledPod, err := json.Marshal(pod)
	if err != nil {
		return admission.Errored(http.StatusInternalServerError, err)
	}
	return admission.PatchResponseFromRaw(req.Object.Raw, marshaledPod)
}
```

If you need a client, just pass in the client at struct construction time.

If you add the `InjectDecoder` method for your handler, a decoder will be
injected for you.

```go
func (a *podAnnotator) InjectDecoder(d *admission.Decoder) error {
	a.decoder = d
	return nil
}
```

**Note**: in order to have controller-gen generate the webhook configuration for
you, you need to add markers. For example,
`// +kubebuilder:webhook:path=/mutate-v1-pod,mutating=true,failurePolicy=fail,groups="",resources=pods,verbs=create;update,versions=v1,name=mpod.kb.io`

## Update main.go

Now you need to register your handler in the webhook server.

```go
mgr.GetWebhookServer().Register("/mutate-v1-pod", &webhook.Admission{Handler: &podAnnotator{Client: mgr.GetClient()}})
```

You need to ensure the path here match the path in the marker.

## Deploy

Deploying it is just like deploying a webhook server for CRD. You need to
1) provision the serving certificate
2) deploy the server

You can follow the [tutorial](/cronjob-tutorial/running.md).
