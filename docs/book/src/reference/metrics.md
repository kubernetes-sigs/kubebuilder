# Metrics

By default, controller-runtime builds a global prometheus registry and
publishes a collection of performance metrics for each controller.

## Protecting the Metrics

These metrics are protected by [kube-auth-proxy](https://github.com/brancz/kube-rbac-proxy)
by default if using kubebuilder. Kubebuilder v2.2.0+ scaffold a clusterrole which
can be found at `config/rbac/auth_proxy_client_clusterrole.yaml`.

You will need to grant permissions to your Prometheus server so that it can
scrape the protected metrics. To achieve that, you can create a
`clusterRoleBinding` to bind the `clusterRole` to the service account that your
Prometheus server uses. If you are using `kube-prometheus`, this cluster binding already exists.

You can run the following kubectl command to create it. If using kubebuilder
`<project-prefix>` is the `namePrefix` field in `config/default/kustomization.yaml`.

```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding metrics --clusterrole=<project-prefix>-metrics-reader --serviceaccount=<namespace>:<service-account-name>
```

## Exporting Metrics for Prometheus

Follow the steps below to export the metrics using the Prometheus Operator:

1. Install Prometheus and Prometheus Operator.
We recommend using [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus#installing)
in production if you don't have your own monitoring system.
If you are just experimenting, you can only install Prometheus and Prometheus Operator.
2. Uncomment the line `- ../prometheus` in the `config/default/kustomization.yaml`.
It creates the `ServiceMonitor` resource which enables exporting the metrics.

```yaml
# [PROMETHEUS] To enable prometheus monitor, uncomment all sections with 'PROMETHEUS'.
- ../prometheus
```

Note that, when you install your project in the cluster, it will create the
`ServiceMonitor` to export the metrics. To check the ServiceMonitor,
run `kubectl get ServiceMonitor -n <project>-system`. See an example:

```
$ kubectl get ServiceMonitor -n monitor-system
NAME                                         AGE
monitor-controller-manager-metrics-monitor   2m8s
```

Also, notice that the metrics are exported by default through port `8443`. In this way,
you are able to check the Prometheus metrics in its dashboard. To verify it, search
for the metrics exported from the namespace where the project is running
`{namespace="<project>-system"}`. See an example:

## Publishing Additional Metrics

If you wish to publish additional metrics from your controllers, this
can be easily achieved by using the global registry from
`controller-runtime/pkg/metrics`.

One way to achieve this is to declare your collectors as global variables and then register them using `init()`.

For example:

```go
import (
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus"
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/metrics"
)

var (
    goobers = prometheus.NewCounter(
        prometheus.CounterOpts{
            Name: "goobers_total",
            Help: "Number of goobers proccessed",
        },
    )
    gooberFailures = prometheus.NewCounter(
        prometheus.CounterOpts{
            Name: "goober_failures_total",
            Help: "Number of failed goobers",
        },
    )
)

func init() {
    // Register custom metrics with the global prometheus registry
    metrics.Registry.MustRegister(goobers, gooberFailures)
}
```

You may then record metrics to those collectors from any part of your
reconcile loop, and those metrics will be available for prometheus or
other openmetrics systems to scrape.
