We start out simply enough: we import the `meta/v1` API group, which is not
normally exposed by itself, but instead contains metadata common to all
Kubernetes Kinds.

/*
Next, we define types for the Spec and Status of our Kind.  Kubernetes functions
by reconciling desired state (`Spec`) with actual cluster state (other objects'
`Status`) and external state, and then recording what it observed (`Status`).
Thus, every *functional* object includes spec and status.  A few types, like
`ConfigMap` don't follow this pattern, since they don't encode desired state,
but most types do.

// EDIT THIS FILE!  THIS IS SCAFFOLDING FOR YOU TO OWN!
// NOTE: json tags are required.  Any new fields you add must have json tags for the fields to be serialized.

// CronJobSpec defines the desired state of CronJob
type CronJobSpec struct {
	// INSERT ADDITIONAL SPEC FIELDS - desired state of cluster
	// Important: Run "make" to regenerate code after modifying this file
}

// CronJobStatus defines the observed state of CronJob
type CronJobStatus struct {
	// INSERT ADDITIONAL STATUS FIELD - define observed state of cluster

/*
Next, we define the types corresponding to actual Kinds, `CronJob` and `CronJobList`.
`CronJob` is our root type, and describes the `CronJob` kind.  Like all Kubernetes objects, it contains
`TypeMeta` (which describes API version and Kind), and also contains `ObjectMeta`, which holds things
like name, namespace, and labels.

`CronJobList` is simply a container for multiple `CronJob`s.  It's the Kind used in bulk operations,
like LIST.

In general, we never modify either of these -- all modifications go in either Spec or Status.

That little `+kubebuilder:object:root` comment is called a marker.  We'll see
more of them in a bit, but know that they act as extra metadata, telling
[controller-tools](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools) (our code and YAML generator) extra information.
This particular one tells the `object` generator that this type represents
a Kind.  Then, the `object` generator generates an implementation of the
[runtime.Object](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime?tab=doc#Object) interface for us, which is the standard
interface that all types representing Kinds must implement.
