/*
The first difference to notice is that kubebuilder has added the new API
group's package (`batchv1`) to our scheme.  This means that we can use those
objects in our controller.

If we would be using any other CRD we would have to add their scheme the same way.
Builtin types such as Job have their scheme added by `clientgoscheme`.
