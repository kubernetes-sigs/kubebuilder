First, let's take a look at our spec.  As we discussed before, spec holds
*desired state*, so any "inputs" to our controller go here.

Fundamentally a CronJob needs the following pieces:

- A schedule (the *cron* in CronJob)
- A template for the Job to run (the
*job* in CronJob)

We'll also want a few extras, which will make our users' lives easier:

- A deadline for starting jobs (if we miss this deadline, we'll just wait till
  the next scheduled time)
- What to do if multiple jobs would run at once (do we wait? stop the old one? run both?)
- A way to pause the running of a CronJob, in case something's wrong with it
- Limits on old job history

Remember, since we never read our own status, we need to have some other way to
keep track of whether a job has run.  We can use at least one old job to do
this.

We'll use several markers (`// +comment`) to specify additional metadata.  These
will be used by [controller-tools](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools) when generating our CRD manifest.
As we'll see in a bit, controller-tools will also use GoDoc to form descriptions for
the fields.

Next, let's design our status, which holds observed state.  It contains any information
we want users or other controllers to be able to easily obtain.

We'll keep a list of actively running jobs, as well as the last time that we successfully
ran our job.  Notice that we use `metav1.Time` instead of `time.Time` to get the stable
serialization, as mentioned above.

we want a status subresource, so that we behave like built-in kubernetes types.
