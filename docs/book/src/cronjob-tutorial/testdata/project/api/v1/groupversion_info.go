First, we have some *package-level* markers that denote that there are
Kubernetes objects in this package, and that this package represents the group
`batch.tutorial.kubebuilder.io`. The `object` generator makes use of the
former, while the latter is used by the CRD generator to generate the right
metadata for the CRDs it creates from this package.

Then, we have the commonly useful variables that help us set up our Scheme.
Since we need to use all the types in this package in our controller, it's
helpful (and the convention) to have a convenient method to add all the types to
some other `Scheme`. SchemeBuilder makes this easy for us.
