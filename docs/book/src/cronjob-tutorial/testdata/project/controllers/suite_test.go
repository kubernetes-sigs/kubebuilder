/*
When we created the CronJob API with `kubebuilder create api` in a [previous chapter](/cronjob-tutorial/new-api.md), Kubebuilder already did some test work for you.
Kubebuilder scaffolded a `controllers/suite_test.go` file that does the bare bones of setting up a test environment.

First, it will contain the necessary imports.

		One thing that this autogenerated file is missing, however, is a way to actually start your controller.
		The code above will set up a client for interacting with your custom Kind,
		but will not be able to test your controller behavior.
		If you want to test your custom controller logic, you’ll need to add some familiar-looking manager logic
		to your BeforeSuite() function, so you can register your custom controller to run on this test cluster.

		You may notice that the code below runs your controller with nearly identical logic to your CronJob project’s main.go!
		The only difference is that the manager is started in a separate goroutine so it does not block the cleanup of envtest
		when you’re done running your tests.

		Note that we set up both a "live" k8s client, separate from the manager.  This is because when making assertions in
		tests, you generally want to assert against the live state of the API server.  If you used the client from the
		manager (`k8sManager.GetClient`), you'd end up asserting against the contents of the cache instead, which is slower
		and can introduce flakiness into your tests.  We could use the manager's `APIReader` to accomplish the same thing,
		but that would leave us with two clients in our test assertions and setup (one for reading, one for writing), and
		it'd be easy to make mistakes.

		Note that we keep the reconciler running against the manager's cache client, though -- we want our controller to
		behave as it would in production, and we use features of the cache (like indicies) in our controller which aren't
		available when talking directly to the API server.
