The first step to writing a simple integration test is to actually create an instance of CronJob you can run tests against.
Note that to create a CronJob, you’ll need to create a stub CronJob struct that contains your CronJob’s specifications.

Note that when we create a stub CronJob, the CronJob also needs stubs of its required downstream objects.
Without the stubbed Job template spec and the Pod template spec below, the Kubernetes API will not be able to
create the CronJob.
