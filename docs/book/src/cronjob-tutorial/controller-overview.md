# What's in a controller?

Controllers are the core of Kubernetes, and of any operator.  

It's a controller's job to ensure that, for any given object, the actual
state of the world (both the cluster state, and potentially external state
like running containers for Kubelet or loadbalancers for a cloud provider)
matches the desired state in the object.  Each controller focuses on one
*root* Kind, but may interact with other Kinds.

We call this process *reconciling*.

In controller-runtime, the logic that implements the reconciling for
a specific kind is called a [*Reconciler*](../TODO.md).  A reconciler
takes the name of an object, and returns whether or not we need to try
again (e.g. in case of errors or periodic controllers, like the
HorizontalPodAutoscaler).

Now that we've seen the basic structure of a reconciler, let's fill out
the logic for `CronJob`s.
