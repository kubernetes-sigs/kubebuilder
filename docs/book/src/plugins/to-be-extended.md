## To help projects using Kubebuilder as Lib to composite new solutions and plugins

Then, see that you can use the kustomize plugin, which is responsible for to scaffold the kustomize files under `config/`, as
the base language plugins which are responsible for to scaffold the Golang files to create your own plugins to work with
another languages (i.e. [Operator-SDK][sdk] does to allow users work with Ansible/Helm) or to add
helpers on top, such as [Operator-SDK][sdk] does to add their features to integrate the projects with [OLM][olm].

| [kustomize.common.kubebuilder.io/v1](kustomize-v1.md)                              | `kustomize/v1`       | Responsible for scaffold all manifests to configure the projects with [kustomize(v3)][kustomize]. (create and update the `config/` directory). This plugin is used in the composition to create the plugin (`go/v3`).                   |
| [kustomize.common.kubebuilder.io/v2-alpha](kustomize-v2-alpha.md)                  | `kustomize/v2-alpha` | It has the same purpose of `kustomize/v1`. However, it works with [kustomize][kustomize] version `v4` and addresses the required changes for future kustomize configurations. It will probably be used with the future `go/v4` plugin. |

This plugin is used in the composition to create the plugin (`go/v3`)                                                                                                    |
