# go/v4 (go.kubebuilder.io/v4)

Kubebuilder will scaffold using the `go/v4` plugin only if specified when initializing the project. 
This plugin is a composition of the plugins ` kustomize.common.kubebuilder.io/v2-alpha` and `base.go.kubebuilder.io/v4`. 
It scaffolds a project template that helps in constructing sets of [controllers][controller-runtime]. 

It scaffolds boilerplate code to create and design controllers. 
Note that by following the [quickstart][quickstart] you will be using this plugin.

<h1>Examples</h1>

You can check samples using this plugin by looking at the `project-v4-<options>` projects 
under the [testdata][testdata] directory on the root directory of the Kubebuilder project.

## When to use it ?

- If you are looking to scaffold Golang projects to develop projects using [controllers][controller-runtime]
- If you are looking to experiment with the future default scaffold that will be provided by Kubebuilder CLI
- If your local environment is Apple Silicon (`darwin/arm64`)
- If you are looking to use [kubernetes-sigs/kustomize][kustomize] v5
- If you are looking to have your project update with the latest version available
- if you are not targeting k8s versions < `1.16` and `1.20` if you are using webhooks
- If you are looking to work on with scaffolds which are compatible with k8s `1.25+`
- If you are looking for the new layout following the [Standard Go Project Layout][standard-go-project] where 
the "api(s)" are scaffold under the `api` directory, "controller(s)" under `internal`, and the `main.go` under `cmd`

<h1>Migration from `go/v3`</h1>

If you have a project created with `go/v3` (default layout since `28 Apr 2021` and Kubebuilder release version `3.0.0`) to `go/v4` then,
see the migration guide [Migration from go/v3 to go/v4](./../migration/migration_guide_gov3_to_gov4.md)
