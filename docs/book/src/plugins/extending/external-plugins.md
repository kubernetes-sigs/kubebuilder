# Creating External Plugins for Kubebuilder

## Overview

Kubebuilder's functionality can be extended through external plugins.
These plugins are executables (written in any language) that follow an
execution pattern recognized by Kubebuilder. Kubebuilder interacts with
these plugins via `stdin` and `stdout`, enabling seamless communication.

## Why Use External Plugins?

External plugins enable third-party solution maintainers to integrate their tools with Kubebuilder.
Much like Kubebuilder's own plugins, these can be opt-in, offering users
flexibility in tool selection. By developing plugins in their repositories,
maintainers ensure updates are aligned with their CI pipelines and can
manage any changes within their domain of responsibility.

If you are interested in this type of integration, collaborating with the
maintainers of the third-party solution is recommended. Kubebuilder's maintainers
is always willing to provide support in extending its capabilities.

## How to Write an External Plugin

Communication between Kubebuilder and an external plugin occurs via
standard I/O. Any language can be used to create the plugin, as long
as it follows the [PluginRequest][code-plugin-external] and [PluginResponse][code-plugin-external]
structures.

### PluginRequest

`PluginRequest` contains the data collected from the CLI and any previously executed plugins. Kubebuilder sends this data as a JSON object to the external plugin via `stdin`.

**Example `PluginRequest` (triggered by `kubebuilder init --plugins sampleexternalplugin/v1 --domain my.domain`):**

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "v1alpha1",
  "args": ["--domain", "my.domain"],
  "command": "init",
  "universe": {}
}
```

### PluginResponse

`PluginResponse` contains the modifications made by the plugin to the project. This data is serialized as JSON and returned to Kubebuilder through `stdout`.

**Example `PluginResponse`:**
```json
{
  "apiVersion": "v1alpha1",
  "command": "init",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "The `init` subcommand initializes a project via Kubebuilder. It scaffolds a single file: `initFile`.",
    "examples": "kubebuilder init --plugins sampleexternalplugin/v1 --domain my.domain"
  },
  "universe": {
    "initFile": "A file created with the `init` subcommand."
  },
  "error": false,
  "errorMsgs": []
}
```

Avoid printing directly to `stdout` in your external plugin.
Since communication between Kubebuilder and the plugin occurs through
`stdin` and `stdout` using structured JSON, any unexpected output
(like debug logs) may cause errors. Write logs to a file if needed.

## How to Use an External Plugin

### Prerequisites

- Kubebuilder CLI version > 3.11.0
- An executable for the external plugin
- Plugin path configuration using `${EXTERNAL_PLUGINS_PATH}` or default OS-based paths:
  - Linux: `$HOME/.config/kubebuilder/plugins/${name}/${version}/${name}`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/kubebuilder/plugins/${name}/${version}/${name}`

**Example:** For a plugin `foo.acme.io` version `v2` on Linux, the path would be `$HOME/.config/kubebuilder/plugins/foo.acme.io/v2/foo.acme.io`.

### Available Subcommands

External plugins can support the following Kubebuilder subcommands:
- `init`: Project initialization
- `create api`: Scaffold Kubernetes API definitions
- `create webhook`: Scaffold Kubernetes webhooks
- `edit`: Update project configuration

**Optional subcommands for enhanced user experience:**
- `metadata`: Provide plugin descriptions and examples with the `--help` flag.
- `flags`: Inform Kubebuilder of supported flags, enabling early error detection.

<aside class="note">
<h1>More about `flags` subcommand</h1>

The `flags` subcommand in an external plugin allows for early error detection by informing Kubebuilder about the flags the plugin supports. If an unsupported flag is identified, Kubebuilder can issue an error before the plugin is called to execute.
If a plugin does not implement the `flags` subcommand, Kubebuilder will pass all flags to the plugin, making it the external plugin's responsibility to handle any invalid flags.

### Configuring Plugin Path

Set the environment variable `$EXTERNAL_PLUGINS_PATH`
to specify a custom plugin binary path:

```sh
export EXTERNAL_PLUGINS_PATH=<custom-path>
```

Otherwise, Kubebuilder would search for the plugins in a default path based on your OS.

### Example CLI Commands

Now, you can using it by calling the CLI commands:

```sh
# Initialize a new project with the external plugin named `sampleplugin`
kubebuilder init --plugins sampleplugin/v1

# Display help information of the `init` subcommand of the external plugin
kubebuilder init --plugins sampleplugin/v1 --help

# Create a new API with the above external plugin with a customized flag `number`
kubebuilder create api --plugins sampleplugin/v1 --number 2

# Create a webhook with the above external plugin with a customized flag `hooked`
kubebuilder create webhook --plugins sampleplugin/v1 --hooked

# Update the project configuration with the above external plugin
kubebuilder edit --plugins sampleplugin/v1

# Create new APIs with external plugins v1 and v2 by respecting the plugin chaining order
kubebuilder create api --plugins sampleplugin/v1,sampleplugin/v2

# Create new APIs with the go/v4 plugin and then pass those files to the external plugin by respecting the plugin chaining order
kubebuilder create api --plugins go/v4,sampleplugin/v1
```
