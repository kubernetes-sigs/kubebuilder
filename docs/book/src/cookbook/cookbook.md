# Cookbook

A curated collection of operator development patterns, use-cases and generic\
recommendations.

## Rationale

While the tutorial part of this book provides onboarding into the operator
realm, real world use cases often surpass the tutorial example(s). Hence we
want to provide a place to share common implementation patterns in order
to enable other users, may they be operator experts or novices, a place to both
share and validate common approaches they encounter while developing operators.

Note that code examples of cookbook entries live as literate Go files in the
book source directory:
[docs/book/src/cookbook/testdata][cookbook-sources]. You may find both snippets
and fully runnable projects among the examples.

*If you are reading this and you are wondering where the entries are: there are
none yet. It is the perfect time for you to contribute something from your
experience in developing operators right now.*
