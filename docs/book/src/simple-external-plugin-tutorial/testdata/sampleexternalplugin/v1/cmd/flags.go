// flagsCmd handles all the logic for the `flags` subcommand of the sample external plugin.
// In Kubebuilder's Phase 2 Plugins the `flags` subcommand is an optional subcommand for
// external plugins to support. The `flags` subcommand allows for an external plugin
// to provide Kubebuilder with a list of flags that the `init`, `create api`, `create webhook`,
// and `edit` subcommands allow. This allows Kubebuilder to give an external plugin the ability
// to feel like a native Kubebuilder plugin to a Kubebuilder user by only binding the supported
// flags and failing early if an unknown flag is provided.
