## Who is this for

#### Users of Kubernetes

Users of Kubernetes will develop a deeper understanding of Kubernetes through learning
the fundamental concepts behind how APIs are designed and implemented.  This book
will teach readers how to develop their own Kubernetes APIs and the
principles from which the core Kubernetes APIs are designed.

Including:

- The structure of Kubernetes APIs and Resources
- API versioning semantics
- Self-healing
- Garbage Collection and Finalizers
- Declarative vs Imperative APIs
- Level-Based vs Edge-Base APIs
- Resources vs Subresources

#### Kubernetes API extension developers

API extension developers will learn the principles and concepts behind implementing canonical
Kubernetes APIs, as well as simple tools and libraries for rapid execution.  This
book covers pitfalls and misconceptions that extension developers commonly encounter.

Including:

- How to batch multiple events into a single reconciliation call
- How to configure periodic reconciliation
- *Forthcoming*
    - When to use the lister cache vs live lookups
    - Garbage Collection vs Finalizers
    - How to use Declarative vs Webhook Validation
    - How to implement API versioning

## Why Kubernetes APIs

Kubernetes APIs provide consistent and well defined endpoints for
objects adhering to a consistent and rich structure.

This approach has fostered a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries for working
with Kubernetes APIs.

Users work with the APIs through declaring objects as *yaml* or *json* config, and using
common tooling to manage the objects.

Building services as Kubernetes APIs provides many advantages to plain old REST, including:

* Hosted API endpoints, storage, and validation.
* Rich tooling and CLIs such as `kubectl` and `kustomize`.
* Support for AuthN and granular AuthZ.
* Support for API evolution through API versioning and conversion.
* Facilitation of adaptive / self-healing APIs that continuously respond to changes
  in the system state without user intervention.
* Kubernetes as a hosting environment

Developers may build and publish their own Kubernetes APIs for installation into
running Kubernetes clusters.
