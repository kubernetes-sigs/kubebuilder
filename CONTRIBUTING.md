# Contributing guidelines

This document describes how to contribute to the project.

## Sign the CLA

Kubernetes projects require that you sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before we can accept your pull requests.

Please see https://git.k8s.io/community/CLA.md for more info.

## Prerequisites

- [go](https://golang.org/dl/) version v1.16+.
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) version 17.03+.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) version v1.11.3+.
- [kustomize](https://sigs.k8s.io/kustomize/docs/INSTALL.md) v3.1.0+
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

## Contributing steps

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
1. The [repo owners](OWNERS) will respond to your issue promptly.
1. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Submit a pull request.

## How to build kubebuilder locally

Note that, by building the kubebuilder from the source code we are allowed to test the changes made locally.

1. Run the following command to clone your fork of the project locally in the dir /src/sigs.k8s.io/kubebuilder

```
$ git clone git@github.com:<user>/kubebuilder.git $GOPATH/src/sigs.k8s.io/kubebuilder
```

1. Ensure you activate module support before continue (`$ export GO111MODULE=on`)
1. Run the command `make install` to create a bin with the source code 

**NOTE** In order to check the local environment run `make test-unit`.

## What to do before submitting a pull request 

1. Run the script `make generate` to update/generate the mock data used in the e2e test in `$GOPATH/src/sigs.k8s.io/kubebuilder/testdata/` 

**IMPORTANT:** The `make generate` is very helpful. By using it, you can check if good part of the commands still working successfully after the changes. Also, note that its usage is a pre-requirement to submit a PR.

Following the targets that can be used to test your changes locally.

|   Command	|   Description	|  Is called in the CI?  	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| make test-unit |  Runs go tests | no   	|
| make test| Runs tests in shell (`./test.sh`)	|  yes 	|
| make lint |  Run [golangci][golangci] lint checks | yes   |
| make lint-fix |   Run [golangci][golangci] to automatically perform fixes | no   |
| make test-coverage |  Run coveralls to check the % of code covered by tests | yes   |
| make check-testdata |  Checks if the testdata dir is updated with the latest changes | yes   |
| make test-e2e-local |  Runs the CI e2e tests locally | no   |

**NOTE** To use the `make lint` is required to install `golangci-lint` locally. More info: https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint#install

## PR Process

See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for a full description.  TL;DR:

Every PR should be annotated with an icon indicating whether it's
a:

- Breaking change: :warning: (`:warning:`)
- Non-breaking feature: :sparkles: (`:sparkles:`)
- Patch fix: :bug: (`:bug:`)
- Docs: :book: (`:book:`)
- Infra/Tests/Other: :seedling: (`:seedling:`)
- No release note: :ghost: (`:ghost:`)

Use :ghost: (no release note) only for the PRs that change or revert unreleased
changes, which don't deserve a release note. Please don't abuse it.

You can also use the equivalent emoji directly, since GitHub doesn't
render the `:xyz:` aliases in PR titles.

Individual commits should not be tagged separately, but will generally be
assumed to match the PR. For instance, if you have a bugfix in with
a breaking change, it's generally encouraged to submit the bugfix
separately, but if you must put them in one PR, mark the commit
separately.

## Where the CI Tests are configured

1. See the [action files](.github/workflows) to check its tests, and the scripts used on it. 
1. Note that the prow tests used in the CI are configured in [kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/kubebuilder-presubmits.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/config/jobs/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/kubebuilder-presubmits.yaml). 
1. Check that all scripts used by the CI are defined in the project.  

## How to contribute to docs

The docs are published off of three branches:

- `book-v3`: [book.kubebuilder.io](https://book.kubebuilder.io) -- current docs
- `book-v2`: [book-v2.kubebuilder.io](https://book.kubebuilder.io) -- legacy docs
- `book-v1`:
  [book-v1.book.kubebuilder.io](https://book-v1.book.kubebuilder.io) --
  legacy docs
- `master`:
  [master.book.kubebuilder.io](https://master.book.kubebuilder.io) --
  "nightly" docs 

See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md#book-releases) for more information.

### How to preview the changes performed in the docs
